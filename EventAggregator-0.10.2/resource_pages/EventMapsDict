Map definitions of the form `<bottom left> <top right> <width> <height> <filename>` for each map. Each corner is specified in the form `<latitude> <longitude>` where northern latitudes are positive, southern latitudes are negative, western longitudes are negative, and eastern longitudes are positive.

Latitudes and longitudes are thus written as `[+|-] <degrees> [ : <minutes> [ : <seconds> ] ]` - in other words, a positive or negative number of degrees optionally followed by a colon and a number of minutes, optionally followed by a colon and a number of seconds.

Widths and heights are specified as numbers of pixels. Each filename must refer to an attachment which has been attached to this page and which has the given filename.

The bundled maps have been generated using [[http://www.mapnik.org/|Mapnik]] according to the [[http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/GettingStarted|Mapnik tutorial]], together with boundary data (`world_borders.zip`) from [[http://mappinghacks.com/data/|Mapping Hacks]].
