This is the events category to which event pages can be assigned.

To add an event to this calendar (by making a page in this category), you can do one of these things:

 * Hover over a day number in the event calendar below and select "New event".
 * Use this action to open a form for adding events: <<Action(EventAggregatorNewEvent,Add an event)>>
 * Fill out and submit this form, then edit the resulting new event page: <<NewPage(EventTemplate,Add an event)>>

Each event must be created on a page belonging to the appropriate event category.

Some ideas:

 * You can add other categories and then separate groups of events by assigning their pages to different categories.
 * You can view many categories in the same calendar if you want to aggregate events from different groups.

To add a new category, fill out and submit this form:

<<NewPage(CategoryTemplate,Add a new category,,Category%s)>>

Here are the current month's events in this category:

<<EventAggregator(CategoryEvents,start=current,end=current,calendar=events)>>

'''List of pages in this category:'''

<<FullSearchCached(category:CategoryEvents)>>
